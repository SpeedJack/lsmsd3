The following frameworks and libraries are used:

\begin{description}
	\item[Neo4J Java driver v1.7.5] \textit{(Server)} for working with the
		Neo4J server;
	\item[XStream v1.4.12] \textit{(Client, Server)} for XML
		serialization/deserialization to transmit objects over the
		network.
\end{description}

In the final implementation of the application, newer versions of the
aforementioned dependencies may be used (if they will be released during the
development). All dependencies are handled with Maven. Other frameworks or
libraries may be added in future.
