\chapter{Specifications}\label{ch:specs}

The application developed for this workgroup task is a tool for
\standout{restaurants recommendations provided by a user social infrastructure}.

The main purpose of the application is to allow restaurant owners to make their
restaurants known to a large number of people and allow the customers to find
the most appreciated restaurants and to create a network of friendships with
other users.

The administrator of the application specifies the available cities and
cuisines. Those can be set in restaurants' and users' profiles.

Before login, a user must register to the application specifying its username,
password and the city where they live.

When logged in, the \standout{user} can see the list of his favorite
restaurants and the list of his friends (followed users). He/She can like
restaurants or remove previously set likes. Also he/she can
follow new friends or unfollow them. He can also specify the
type of cuisines he is interested in. A user can view a list of
restaurants that the application recommends, based on number of likes put by
friends (or friends of friends). Recommendations can be filtered considering
the distance between the restaurant's and user's city, the cuisine and the
number of likes from the users he follows.

The application also can provide advises for new people to follow with same
interests in types of cuisine.

A \standout{restaurant owner} can add a restaurant (or many), inserting all the
information as the name, the city where is located and the type of cuisine. He
can also modify information whenever he wants. The owner can see the number of
his restaurant's likes and see how his/her restaurants are ranked in the city
where they are located considering all restaurants of the city or considering
restaurants with the same type of cuisine.
