\section{Introduction}

Ristogo is an application used to recommend restaurants to people. Every user
can be only a customer or also a restaurateur, which can manage more
functionalities.

Every user can follow other users as in a social application and can also put
like to his/her favourite restaurants.

Information of followers and likes are used to recommend restaurants to the
user, using his/her friends preferences.

Restaurateurs can manage their restaurants modifying information in every moment
and can see the position (calculated with the number of likes) in the
restaurant's ranking with the same cuisine or in the same city.
